At the beginning of my software career I was mesmerized by complexity. My understanding was that the more complex something is the better it must be

I was impressed by all the frameworks and libraries. It all started when I learned React. The JavaScript ecosystem heavily leans towards the use of frameworks and libraries. Abstractions upon abstractions. The aim is to empower developer productivity but the cost is that the developer will never truly understand what's going on under the hood. Plato's cave.

This personal website is my exploration of how far I can go without using any frameworks and libraries. The goal is to find out how much I can build from scratch by only using bun + typescript. even for deployment and hosting i'm trying to steer clear of frameworks and libraries.

Over time this corner of the internet will become a place where I can share my thoughts and ideas. I'm not sure what it will become but I'm excited to see where it goes.
